# TODO

- [ ] add colorization for different file types, folders and symlinks. Make it
      customizable and theme-able. Make it default but allow an option to
      disable it (or vice-versa). Files that have a known extension should all
      be colored the same way, and different to unknown file tipes.
- [ ] for a symlink, color the name as it is, but color the target depending on
      whether it is a directory, file, or symlink.
- [ ] colorize the short-form output same as the long-form output.
- [ ] Add icons for partials like `TODO.*`, `LICENSE.*` and more.
- [ ] option to grey-out files in the `.gitignore`.
- [ ] using the config file, allow extending the existing file and folder
      mapping, or deleting specific maps.
- [ ] add a -R flag to recursively list files in a directory.
- [ ] better handle dotfiles?
- [ ] option to list dotfiles (and folders) before non-dotfiles
